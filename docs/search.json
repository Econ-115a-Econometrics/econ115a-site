It should be specific enough to signal your topic and variables, but flexible enough to evolve later.\n\n\nBrief Rationale (max 500 words)\nExplain why your topic matters. Include background context, relevance to policy or development, and the gap your research aims to address. Use economic reasoning and cite any known data sources or studies if applicable.\n\n\nResearch Hypotheses\nList 1–2 testable statements based on your earlier assignment. These should be causal or correlational claims that you will evaluate using econometric methods.\n\n\nResearch Questions (max 5)\nInclude up to five questions that guide your investigation. These should be answerable using data and aligned with your hypotheses. You may reuse or refine the questions from your previous assignment.\n\n\nResearch Objectives\nWrite one main objective that summarizes your research aim. Then list up to three specific objectives that break down your analysis into measurable tasks. Each objective should correspond to a hypothesis or question.\n\n\nData Sources\nFor each specific objective, identify the type of data you need (primary or secondary), and describe the specific datasets or variables you plan to use. Be realistic and specific.\n\n\nOptional: Proposed Methodologies\nBriefly describe the econometric techniques you plan to use for each objective (e.g., regression analysis, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables). This section is optional but encouraged.",

Your focus will be on university students as the population of interest. Later in the course, you will gather and analyze data to test your ideas.\nInstructions:\n\nDevelop a Theory\n\n\nPropose a brief theoretical statement (or set of statements) that explains a relationship between two or more variables relevant to university student behavior, attitudes, or outcomes. Your theory should reflect a plausible mechanism or pattern that could be tested statistically.\nExamples:\n\nStudents who sleep fewer than six hours per night are more likely to report academic stress.\nParticipation in student organizations improves self-reported leadership confidence.\nStudents with part-time jobs are less likely to attend extracurricular academic seminars.\n\n\n\nFormulate Hypotheses\n\n\nBased on your theory, write at least one testable hypothesis. This should be a specific, measurable statement that can be evaluated using statistical methods.\nExamples:\n\nStudents who sleep fewer than six hours will score higher on a standardized stress scale than those who sleep more.\nStudents involved in two or more organizations will rate their leadership confidence higher than those not involved.\n\n\n\nGenerate Research Questions\n\n\nWrite at least three research questions that emerge from your theory and hypotheses. These should be clear, focused, and suitable for quantitative analysis.\nExamples:\n\nWhat is the average number of hours university students sleep on weekdays?\nIs there a significant relationship between sleep duration and academic stress levels?\nDo students with part-time jobs attend fewer academic events than those without?",
